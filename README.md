# software-glossary
A general glossary of software development terminology, abbreviations and other commonplace words.

Terms are in alphabetical order. Feel free to suggest additional words or abbreviations.

### CSS
Short for "cascading style sheets". CSS is a style sheet language used to style web pages and applications, including but not limited to positioning, colours, fonts, sizes and animations. It needs to be used in conjunction with a markup language, essentially always HTML. The current version is CSS3.

### HTML
Short for "hypertext markup language". The standard markup language for documents and applications displayed on the web. It is used to create the basic structure and metadata of a page, while CSS and JavaScript are used for styling and functionality, respectively. The current version is HTML5.

### Markup Language
A language used to determine a ruleset that dictates what information to display and how in a document, such as a web application. XML and HTML are examples of markup languages. They are distinct from programming languages, but in some cases, such as with TeX, the distinction is difficult to make.

### Turing completeness
A machine or piece of software is Turing complete if it functions like a Turing machine. In other words, if something, such as a programming language, can be theoretically used to run any kind of a program, it is Turing complete. Practically all programming languages and various other pieces of software are Turing complete.

### WYSIWYG
Short for "what you see is what you get". Refers to software or documents that look the same while they are being developed or edited as the end result would.
